# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Human vs AI)
This project is a **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** developed using **Python**.  
The game allows a human player to compete against an **AI opponent** that uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal decisions.

## Objective
To understand and implement:
- Game logic
- Basic search algorithms
- Decision-making using Minimax

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay
- AI implemented using Minimax algorithm
- Emoji-based board display
- User-friendly input (positions 1–9)
- Console-based application
- 
## Algorithm Used
**Minimax Algorithm**  
The AI evaluates all possible game states and selects the best move to either win or force a draw, ensuring optimal gameplay.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python**
- IDE: **Visual Studio Code**
- Concepts: Game Theory, Recursion, Conditional Logic
- 
## How to Run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code  
2. Open Terminal  
3. Run the command:
```powershell
python TIC-TAC-TOE.py

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understanding AI decision-making
2. Implementing recursive algorithms
3. Building logic-based games in Python

#Task No.2

# Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses

## Project Overview
This is a simple Python-based chatbot that interacts with the user using predefined rules. It responds to user commands, provides study tips, project guidance, jokes, and maintains a chat history. The chatbot demonstrates basic natural language processing concepts and conversation flow using `if-else` statements.

## Features
- Personalized greeting with user name
- Time-based greetings (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Rule-based responses for commands:
  - `help` – List available commands
  - `study` – Study tips
  - `project` – Project guidance
  - `joke` – Tells two jokes
  - `Chat History` – Displays previous conversation
  - `exit` – Exit the chatbot
- Stores conversation history in a list for review

## Technology Used
- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries: `datetime`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the file.
2. Open terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the chatbot using:
   ```bash
   python CHATBOT_WITH_RULE_BASED_RESPONCES.py

## Learning Outcome
Understanding of rule-based chatbot development
Implementation of conversation flow using if-else conditions
Basic handling of user input and state management (chat history)
Practice in Python programming and project structuring

# Task No. 3

# Book Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This is a simple rule-based book recommendation system implemented in Python.  
The system allows users to select a book category (Indian, Global, Marathi) and genre (Novel, Short Stories, Autobiography, Self-Help, Motivational, Mythology, Historical).  
Based on the user’s selection, the system provides a list of recommended books.

## Features
- User selects **book category** and **genre**.
- Provides **5–6 book recommendations** per selection.
- Simple **if-else based logic**, easy to understand and extend.
- Includes a polite **Thank You message** at the end.

## How to Run
1. Save the code as `book_recommendation_system.py`.
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python Book_Recommendation_System.py

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Standard Python libraries only

## Learning Outcomes
Understanding of rule-based recommendation systems.
Applying conditional statements for decision making.
Organizing content-based recommendations based on user preferences.
User-friendly interactive console programs.
